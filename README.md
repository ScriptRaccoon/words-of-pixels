# Words of Pixels

https://wordsofpixels.netlify.app/

This is an animation which creates a sequence of images built up from moving pixels.

The images are in the folder `public` and can be customized arbitrarily. The background has to be black (or dark enough), the drawn pixels have to be white (or light enough). When you customize the images, make sure to update `src/config.ts` as well.
